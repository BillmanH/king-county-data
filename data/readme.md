# Data folder

To hide results of queries, this is added to the gitignore. 

The data table has the following format: 
*`parcel_numbers.txt` (required) the list of parcels you want to get data for. 
One parcel per row, just the number. 

* outputs are saved in excel format (also ignored in the repo)
